The ACL Anthology is built using completely open-source software, with further developments and customization done by the ACL Anthology staff.
The current Anthology website is statically generated using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework, with the layout being designed using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library.
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is used as the icon font.

The [source code](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/) for the Anthology is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/>.
