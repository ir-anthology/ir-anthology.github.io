---

The ACL materials that are hosted in the Anthology are licensed to the general public under a liberal usage policy that allows unlimited reproduction, distribution and hosting of materials on any other website or medium, for non-commercial purposes.
Prior to 2016, all ACL materials are licensed using the [Creative Commons 3.0 BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) (Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share-Alike) license.
As of 2016, this policy has been relaxed further, and all subsequent materials are available to the general public on the terms of the [Creative Commons 4.0 BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (Attribution) license; this means both commercial and non-commercial use is explicitly licensed to all.

Note that these policies only cover ACL materials.
As with [the DOIs]({{< relref "doi.md" >}}), this policy does not cover third-party materials.
For reproduction privileges for such materials, please approach the respective organizations.
