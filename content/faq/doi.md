Title: How does the ACL Anthology use Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)?
weight: 2
---

The ACL uses DOIs to refer to scholarly works persistently in accordance with
cross-disciplinary standards. Prior to 2012, ACL materials were assigned DOIs by
the Association of Computational Machinery (ACM). Since 2014, ACL has assigned
its own DOIs to materials using a convention based off of the ACL Anthology
Identifiers. In 2015, ACL had to change DOI prefix due to accounting practices
for the ACM.

Prefixes:

+ **2014--2015:** 10.3115
+ **2015--current:** 10.18653

*We strongly encourage the publication of DOIs in citing bibliographies to help
better cross-reference ACL materials.*

Note while the ACL Anthology hosts third-party materials coming from sister
societies, these materials are hosted courtesy the ACL but are not assigned DOIs
by the ACL due to costs and copyright limitations; the DOI information above is
only applicable to ACL sponsored events by ACL, its chapters or SIGs.
